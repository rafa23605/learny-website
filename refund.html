      <h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>
      <p>At Learny, we want you to be completely satisfied with our Service. We understand that sometimes a product may not meet your expectations, and we've designed our refund policy to be fair and straightforward.</p>
      <p>All payments are processed by <strong>Tribute.tg</strong>. Refunds are issued to your original payment method.</p>

      <h2 id="free-trial">2. Free Trial</h2>
      <p>We offer a <strong>3-day free trial</strong> so you can experience the full Service before committing to a subscription.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No payment is required during the free trial period</li>
        <li>You will not be charged unless you actively subscribe after the trial ends</li>
        <li>You can cancel or simply stop using the Service during the trial with no charge</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We encourage you to use the free trial to determine whether Learny is right for you before subscribing.</p>

      <h2 id="subscription-refunds">3. Subscription Refunds</h2>

      <h3>3.1 Within 14 Days of First Payment</h3>
      <p>If you are not satisfied with the Service after your first payment, you may request a <strong>full refund within 14 days</strong> of being charged — no questions asked.</p>

      <h3>3.2 After 14 Days</h3>
      <p>Refund requests made after 14 days from your payment will be considered on a case-by-case basis. We may offer a pro-rata refund for the unused portion of your billing period at our discretion.</p>

      <h3>3.3 Subscription Renewals</h3>
      <p>To avoid being charged for the next billing period, please cancel your subscription <strong>before the renewal date</strong>. If you forget to cancel and are charged for a renewal:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contact us within 7 days of the renewal charge</li>
        <li>We will issue a full refund for the unwanted renewal, provided you have not used the Service extensively during the new billing period</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.4 Cancellation Without Refund</h3>
      <p>If you cancel your subscription mid-cycle and do not request a refund, you will retain access to the Service until the end of your current billing period. No partial refund is automatically issued for cancellations.</p>

      <h2 id="how-to-request">4. How to Request a Refund</h2>
